# CleanAI

## Clean AI is a tool meant for cleaning datasets used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). 

The goal is to make AI training more accessible. It is important that everyone
who is interested in the topic gets to utilise it to its full potential. 

For now this is only a personal project but I will continue to make improvments to the code
to the best of my abilities. **I'm in no way a professional** (which is one of the reasons I decided to pick up this project) so if you have any recomendations for cleaner code or better optimisation please feel free to clone this repository and I'll review any push.
