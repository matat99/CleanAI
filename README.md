# CleanAI

Clean-AI is an open-source tool designed to streamline and automate the process of cleaning data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

**The Project is in very early stages at the moment**

## Motivation

The goal is to make AI training more accessible. It is important that everyone
who is interested in the topic gets to utilise it to its full potential. Especially in a time where interest in AI technologies and capabilities is at an all time high.

For now this is only a personal project but I will continue to make improvments to the code
to the best of my abilities whenever I have time. **I'm in no way a professional when it comes to coding or machine learning!** (which is one of the reasons I decided to pick up this project) So if you have any recomendations for cleaner code or better optimisation please feel free to fork this repository and I'll try to review any pull request.

## Installation
