respectively, effective february 21,  2023, on the understanding that these selections were  subject to being satisfactory to the federal reserve bank of new york.', 'secretary ’s note:  the federal reserve bank of  new york subsequently sent advice that the selections indicated previously were satisfactory.', '4 chiara scotti’s selection was set to be effective upon her employment with the federal reserve bank of dallas.', 'minutes of the meeting of january 31–february 1, 2023 page 3 as part of the annual review of the committee’s governance documents for open market operations and foreign  currency transactions, the committee unanimously approved a new governance document titled “fomc authorizations and continuing directives for open market operations.” 3  the new document includes ( 1) authorizations previously in the committee’s authorization for foreign currency operati ons and authorization for  domestic open market operations; (2) a new “continuing directive for domestic open market operations,”  which combines direction to the desk in the standing  repurchase agreement facility and fima repurchase agreement facility resol utions with direction to the  desk to continue to carry out other ongoing activities;  (3) the foreign currency directive ; and (4) two other  existing documents related to contingency arrangements .', 'the new unified document improves clarity and  transparency in the governance of desk activities but  does not make substantive changes to governance.', 'the domestic policy directive released after each fomc meeting will have modest conforming changes going forward.', 'ahead of the vote on policies relating to information security, external communications, and investment and trading, the chair commented on the critical  importance  of maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in the  federal reserve as an institution and indicated that these  policies were very important in that regard.', 'all participants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by the  requirements of , the program for security of fomc information (program), the fomc policy on external  communications of committee participants, the fomc  policy on external communications of federal reserve system staff, and the investment and trading policy for  fomc officials .', 'the committee voted unanimously to  reaffirm all four policies without revision .', '3   as part of  the committee’s annual organizational review  process, all participants indicated support  for the statement on longerrun goals and monetary policy strategy, and the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm  it without revision.3    developments in financial markets and open  market operations   the manager pro tem turned first to a review of u.s.  financial market developments.', 'market participants  generally expected u.s. economic growth to moderate  this year, although there was a wide dispersion in views  about the extent of a potential slowdown.', 'market participants interpreted incoming data as pointing to moderating inflation risks.', 'against this backdrop, market participants judged that the fomc would likely slow the pace of rate increases further at the current meeting, and  respondents to the desk ’s survey of primary d ealers  and survey of m arket participants widely expected the  committee to implement a ¼ percentage point increase  in the target range for the federal funds rate.', 'survey respondents assessed that uncertainty around the likely  peak level of the policy  rate narrowed relative to the  comparable results from the december surveys and, on average, placed significant probability on a target federal  funds rate range close to 5 percent .', 'a significant share  of survey respondents anticipated that the committee  would hold the policy rate stable for much of 2023.', 'moderating inflation in the united states and improving  global growth prospects lifted market sentiment.', 'while  most desk survey respondents expected subdued growth or a mild recession  in 2023, market participants  continued to see notable uncertainties ahead, including  prospects for a deeper downturn or the potential for  more persistent inflation.', 'regarding the international outlook, signs of a faster reopening in china and a less severe downturn in eur ope  eased  concerns about global growth, contributing to a  depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar and supporting optimism about emerging market economies .', 'narrowing interest rate differentials between the u nited  states and other advanced foreign economies also contributed to dollar depreciation, as some foreign central bank communications suggested a need for further monetary policy tightening to address inflation pressures.', 'in  addition, the bank of japan unexpectedly widened its  yield curve control band at its december meeting to address market functioning issues in the market for japanese government bond s.  over the period, some other  central banks communicated that they were at or near a point where it would be appropriate to pause policy rate increases and assess the effects of cumulative policy tightening.', 'the manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money markets and federal reserve operations.', 'money market rates were stable over the period , with the yearend passing smoothly.', 'as expected, balances in the  overnight reverse repurchase agreement ( on rrp) facility increased at yearend but quickly retraced.', 'market  participants generally expected usage of the on rrp facility to continue a downward trend in 2023, moderating the decline in reserve balances as the federal reserve’s  holdings of securities continue to run off.', 'should transitory pressures occur in money markets over the course of the year, the manager pro tem noted that the standing  page 4 federal open market committee   repurchase agreement (repo) facility and discount window would be available to help support effective monetary policy implementation.', 'the manager noted that, over coming months, developments affecting the treasury general account (tga) and treasury financing could infl uence money market  conditions.', 'an increase in tga balances associated with april individual tax receipts could result in a temporary decline in reserve balances .', 'in subsequent  months, uncertainties associated with the debt limit  could also be important .', 'in particular, the treasury  could increase bill issuance to rebuild tga balances   once the debt limit is lifted , reducing reserves and potentially lifting money market rates .', 'the manager pro   tem noted that in recent months , investors in the  on rrp facility had responded to small increases in  money market rates by shifting balances into private investments , and that reductions in on rrp volumes  may help smooth adjustments in money markets.', 'by unanimous vote, the committee ratified the desk ’s  domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.', 'there were no intervention operations in foreign  currencies for the system’ s account during the  intermeeting period.', 'staff review of the economic situation   the information available at the time of the january 31 – february 1 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained tight in december, with the unemployment rate at a historical low.', 'consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12month percent  change in the  price index for personal consumption expenditures  (pce)—continued to step down in november and december but was still elevated.', 'real gross domestic product (gdp) increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter  of last year.', 'total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in  december , although  at a slower pace than in the previous two months.', 'the unemployment rate moved back  down to 3.5  percent  in december.', 'the unemployment  rate for african americans was unchanged, and the unemployment rate for hispanics ticked up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure.', 'the aggregate measures of both the labor  force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation ratio edged up.', 'the privatesector job openings  rate, as measured  by the job openings and labor turnover survey, was flat in november and remained high.', 'measures of nominal wage growth slowed at the end of  last year but continued to be elevated.', 'the threemonth change in the employment cost index (eci) of hourly compensation in the private sector slowed to a 4.0  percent annual rate in december, while the threemonth  change measure of average hourly earnings (ahe) for all employees eased to an annual rate of 4.1  percent.', 'over the 12 months ending in december, the eci increased 5.1  percent , and ahe rose 4.6  percent .', 'consumer price inflation eased in november and december but remained elevated.', 'total pce price inflation was 5.0  percent over the 12 months ending in december, 1.1 percent age points lower than the october  figure.', 'core pce price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.4  percent  over the 12 months ending  in december, down 0.7  percent age point from its october reading.', 'the trimmed mean measure of 12month  pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 4.4  percent  in december, 0.3  percentage point lower than in october.', 'the latest surveybased readings on longerterm inflation expectations  from the univ ersity of michigan surveys of consumers  and the federal reserve bank of new york’s survey of  consumer expectations remained within the range of  their values reported in recent months, while nearterm  measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down along with actual inflation.', 'although real gdp expanded at an annual rate of  2.9 percent  in the fourth quarter, real private domestic  final purchases (pdfp)—which includes pce, residential investment, and business fixed  investment —increased at a subdued annual rate of 0.2  percent .', 'real  gdp growth was bolstered especially by a large gain in inventory investment and a notable contribution from net exports, as imports fell more than exports .', 'both inventories and net exports are volatile categories in aggregate spending.', 'regarding  production, u.s. manufacturing output declined sizably in both november and december.', 'foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the covid19related slowdown in  china and repercussions of russia’s war against ukraine.', 'weaker global demand and a rebalancing from goods to  services also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in  manufacturing, which weighed on activity in emerging asia.', 'in china, the pivot away from its  zerocovid  policy appears to have resulted in a rapid surge in virus  cases late in the year , but also in a rebound in activity as  restrictions were rapidly removed.', 'in europe, the slowdown in economic growth was tempered by mild winter weather, which also prompted further declines in energy    minutes of the meeting of january 31–february 1, 2023 page 5 prices.', 'a decline in retail energy as well as food prices  contributed to an easing in headline consumer price inflation in many foreign economies.', 'with core inflation  remaining elevated amid tight labor markets, however, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy.', 'staff review of the financial situation   over the intermeeting period, the marketimplied federal funds rate path was little changed for 2023 but moderately moved down further out.', 'nominal treasury  yields were little changed, while swapsbased inflation  compensation measures fell notably.', 'stock  market indexes were slightly higher, and market volatility declined but remained slightly elevated.', 'businesses and households continued to face elevated borrowing costs.', 'credit quality remained strong overall, although there  were some signs of deterior ation for consumer loans.', 'the marketimplied federal funds rate path for 2023 was  little changed, on net, during the intermeeting period but fell moderately beyond mid2024.', 'on net, nominal  treasury yields were roughly unchanged , and swapsmarketimplied inflation compensation measures fell  notably.', 'broad stock price indexes ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher despite sizable fluctuations.', 'equity prices fell sharply following the december fomc statement but recovered over the remainder of t he period in  response to data releases.', 'the vix —the onemonth  optionimplied volatility on the s&p 500 —decreased  somewhat but remained slightly above the median range of its historical distribution.', 'spreads on investmentgrade and highyield corporate bonds narrowed somewhat, on net , over the intermeeting period, while spreads  on municipal bonds narrowed substantially.', 'conditions in shortterm funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the december increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the federal reserve’s administered rates passing through quickly to overnight money  market rates.', 'in secured markets, repo rates were roughly the same as the on  rrp offering rate but continued to occasionally print slightly higher around days  with treasury bill and coupon settlements.', 'daily takeup in the on rrp facility remained elevated, reflecting  continued elevated assets under management (aum) for  money market mutual funds (mmfs), ongoing uncertainty around the policy path, and limited supply of alternative investments such as treasury bills.', 'net yields on mmfs  rose further over the intermeeting period,  mostly passing through the increase in administered rates.', 'bank deposit rates gradually increased but continued to lag cumulative increases in the federal funds rate.', 'over the intermeeting period, investor perceptions of an improved economic outlook in china and europe contributed to increases in foreign risky asset prices and weighed on the  exchange value of the dollar.', 'global equity indexes rose, supported in part by lower european natural gas prices and china’s decision to abandon its zerocovid policy.', 'sovereign yields increased notably  in the euro area and japan, reflecting morerestrictivethanexpected co mmunications from the european  central bank and the bank of japan’s decision to widen its yield curve control target band, respectively.', 'in contrast, yields in other major advanced foreign economies  were little changed on net.', 'the staff’s broad dollar index  declined over the intermeeting period, with larger declines against emerging market economy (eme) currencies amid significant inflows into emefocused investment funds in january on improved investor sentiment.', 'narrowing yield differentials between the united states and some advanced foreign economies also contributed to the depreciation of the dollar.', 'in domestic credit markets, businesses and households continued to face elevated borrowing costs.', 'yields for corporate bonds declined, while borrowing costs for leveraged loans were little changed at elevated levels.', 'bank  interest rates for commercial and industrial (c&i) loans  continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter.', 'yields on municipal bonds declined during the intermeeting period but remai ned above their historical average.', 'residential mortgage rates were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained well above their levels in the previous tightening cycle, notwithstanding the decline from their peak in early november.', 'interest rates  on existing credit cards continued to increase in recent months, and interest rates on new auto loans also rose through midjanuary.', 'credit remained broadly available for businesses and  households with strong credit quality but remained tight  for lowerrated borrowers.', 'lending standards tightened  further for bankdependent borrowers.', 'issuance of corporate bonds was subdued in december before picking  up somewhat in january.', 'new launches of leveraged  loans were notably subdued in december and janua ry,  likely reflecting soft investor demand and higher reference rates on floatingrate loans.', 'in the january senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices (sloos), banks reported having tightened c&i and commercial real estate (cre)  page 6 federal open market committee   lending  standards over the previous three months.', 'although c&i loans at banks continued to expand through  december, they decelerated relative to earlier in the year,  in line with tighter lending standards and weaker demand for c&i loans over the fourth quarter.', 'cre loan growth  on domestic banks’ balance sheets remained robust in  the fourth quarter.', 'meanwhile, issuance of commercial  mortgagebacked securities  remained slow in november  and december, amid high base interest rates and  spreads.', 'some tightening in lending conditions was also  evident for small businesses, with the share of small  firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier continuing to trend up through december.', 'credit was broadly available in the residential mortgage  market for highcreditscore borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria.', 'credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably  tighter, though comparable to levels prevailing before  the pandemic.', 'purchas e mortgage applications and refinance applications were both little changed over the intermeeting period.', 'home equity line of credit (heloc)  balances at banks continued to grow through the fourth  quarter, on net, potentially reflecting homeowners using helocs as a preferred way of extracting home equity in the presence of high current mortgage rates.', 'in the  january sloos, banks reported tighter standards for all  consumer loans.', 'even so, total credit card balances increased at a solid pace in november , while auto loans  grew modestly.', 'overall, credit quality remained strong, al though there  was some deterioration for credit card and auto loan  borrowers and some predictors of future credit quality worsened a bit further.', 'the volume of corporate bond  rating downgrades outpaced upgrades in december, although the level of downgrades remained moderate.', 'leveraged loans experienced notable net rating downgrades in december, but the pace moderated in january.', 'default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans  remained low.', 'measures of expected default probabilities for corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained elevated relative to their historical distributions.', 'the  credit quality of businesses that borrow from banks remained sound, on balance, although, in the january  sloos, banks reported expecting a deterioration in the quality of business loans in their portfolio over 2023.', 'delinquencies on small business loans continued to edge  up in november but remained low relative to historical levels.', 'the credi t quality of households also remained strong,  on balance, despite some signs of deterioration.', 'delinquencies for federal housing administration mortgages  increased slightly, but overall mortgage delinquency  rates were still near prepandemic lows.', 'delinq uency  rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise  during the third quarter.', 'while delinquency rates on  credit cards were still relatively low, those on auto loans rose above prepandemic levels.', 'in the january sloos,  banks reported expecting a further deterioration in the  quality of household loans in 2023, especially for consumer loans.', 'the staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the u.s. financial  system as moderate.', 'the staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained notable.', 'in particular, the staff  noted that measures of valuations in both residential and  commercial property markets remained high, and that  the potential for large declines in property prices remained greater than usual.', 'in addition, the forward pricetoearnings ratio for s&p 500 firms remained  above its median value despite the decline in equity prices over the past year.', 'the staff assessed that valuation pressures had eased for corporate bonds and leveraged loans, as spreads in both markets had increased  from recent lows.', 'the staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with  household and business leverage remained moderate, noting that althou gh measures of business leverage were  at or near a historically high level, the ability of firms to service their debt has kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates.', 'household borrowing rose for borrowers with prime credit scores but declined fo r households with lower credit scores.', 'vulnerabilities associated with financial leverage also remained moderate.', 'in particular, riskbased capital ratios for banks increased  slightly , a staff measure of leverage at life insurance companies remained rela tively flat in recent quarters , and leverage among private credit funds has remained steady for several years.', 'while measures of hedge fund leverage have decreased since the pandemic shock, the staff  noted that leverage among the largest funds was on trac k  to return to 2019 levels.', 'vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate.', 'the rising rate environment has  prompted inflows into prime retail mmfs , while aum  at prime institutional funds, which have proved more  sensitive to turmoil in the past, have grown much less.', 'assets in openend mutual funds that invest in less liquid    minutes of the meeting of january 31–february 1, 2023 page 7 instruments like bank loans or highyield corporate  bonds have declined notably over the past year.', 'in response to vulnerabilities at mmfs and openend mutual  funds, the securities and exchange commission has  proposed rules to make these funds more resilient.', 'staff economic outlook   the forecast for the u.s. economy prepared by the staff  for this fomc meeting had a somewhat higher path for  the level of real gdp and a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate than in the december projection, reflecting both the recent data and a small additional boost  to output from a lower projected path for the dollar.', 'although recent data indicated that real gdp growth in  the fourth quarter of 2022 was stronger than expected, real pdfp growth  was weaker than previously forecast,  and the large, unexpected boost to gdp growth from  inventory investment was not projected to persist.', 'in  part reflecting the lagged effects of previous monetary  policy tightening, the staff still projected real gdp  growth to slow markedly this year and the labor market to soften.', 'the staff forecast continued to include a pickup in real gdp growth starting next year, although   projected  output growth in 2024 and 2025 remains below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth.', 'the level of real output was expected to move down to the staff’s estimate of potential near the end of 2 025.', 'likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to gradually move up to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025.', 'on a fourquarter change basis, total pce price inflation  was forecast to be 2.8  percent  in 2023, and core inflation  was expected to be 3.2  percent, both lower than in the  december projection.', 'with the effects of supply– demand imbalances in goods markets expected to further  unwind and labor and product markets projected to become less tight, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would decline further over 2024 and 2025.', 'on a fourquarter change basis, core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, and  core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to slow as nominal  wage growth eased.', 'with steep declines in consumer  energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected t o step down markedly this year and then to track  core inflation over the following two years.', 'in 2025, both total and core pce price inflation were expected to be near 2  percent .', 'the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected this year and  the persistently tight financial  conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime this year as a plausible alternative to the baseline.', 'moreover, with core pce price inflation having  slowed in recent months, along with the cumulative upward revisions to the core inflation projection over the past year and the expected softening in economic  growth, the staff now viewed the risks around the baseline forecast for inflation this year as balanced.', 'for beyond this year, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as skewed to the upside,  reflecting concerns about the potential persistence of inflation.', 'participants ’ views on current conditions and the  economic outlook   in their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest  growth in spending and production.', 'nonetheless, job  gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low.', 'inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated.', 'participants recognized  that russia’s war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to elevated global uncertainty.', 'against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to  inflation risks.', 'participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to  date had reduced demand in the most interestratesensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing.', 'participants observed that growth in economic activity in 2022 had been below its long errun trend and expected  that real gdp growth would slow further in 2023.', 'while real gdp growth had rebounded in the second half of 2022, several participants noted that growth in pdfp   had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter.', 'with inflation  remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that  a period of belowtrend growth in real gdp would be  needed to bring aggregate demand  into better balance  with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary  pressures.', 'some participants judged that recent economic data signaled a somewhat higher chance of continued subdued economic growth, with inflation fall ing  over time to the committee’s longerrun go al of 2  percent, although  some participants noted that the probability of the economy entering a recession in 2023 remained elevated.', 'page 8 federal open market committee   in their discussion of the household sector, participants  observed that real consumer spending had declined  in  november and december —in part reflecting the tightening in financial conditions over the past year —and anticipated that consumption would likely grow at a subdued rate in 2023.', 'participants noted that excess savings  accumulated during the pandemic had continued to support consumption, although several participants remarked that the importance of this factor would likely  wane over time as excess savings continued to be drawn  down or eroded by inflation.', 'a couple of participants  observed that some consu mers were shifting their  spending to less expensive alternatives.', 'a few participants noted the effects of higher interest costs in restraining consumption or inhibiting the ability of some  households to repay their loans, while a couple of participants noted that inflation was eroding households’ purchasing power .', 'however, a couple of participants  noted that some states could return part of their sizable budget surpluses to households through tax cuts or rebates, which would provide support to consumption .', 'participants agreed that activity in the housing market  had continued to weaken, largely reflecting the increase  in mortgage rates  over the past year .', 'regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment spending had been  subdued in the fourth quarter  and was being restrained  by past interest rate increases.', 'a number of participants  commented that supply bottlenecks continued to eas e,  although supply chain issues remained a challenge in  some s ectors .', 'several participants remarked that the recent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow; a couple of those participants noted  that businesses appeared more confident that significant supply  bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore  choose to hold smaller inventories.', 'some participants commented that the easing of covidrelated lockdown  restrictions in china or strongerthanexpected growth  in economic activity in the e uro area could  provide support to final demand  in the u nited states.', 'participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially exceeded the supply of available workers.', 'participants  noted that the unemployment rate had returned to a historically low level in december, job va cancies remained  high, and wage growth remained elevated.', 'several participants noted  that recent reductions in the workforces  of some large technology businesses followed much  larger increases  over the previous few years  and judged  that these reductions d id not appear to reflect widespread weakness in the demand for labor.', 'a few participants remarked that some business contacts  appeared  keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges.', 'participants agreed that labor supply remained constrained by structural factors such as the effects from the pandemic, including those on early retirements , and the reduced availability and increased cost of childcare.', 'nevertheless,  participants noted tentative signs that imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market were improving, with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels, the average number of hours worked falling, and growth in wages and employment costs slowing.', 'some participants commented on  the recent reduction in temporary employment, which previously had often preceded more widespread reductions in labor demand.', 'under appropriate monetary  policy, participants expected labor market demand  and  supply to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressure on nominal wages and prices.', 'a number  of participants commented on the importance of recognizing  that, to the extent national unemployment increases , historical evidence indicates that even larger increases in the unemployment rate for some demographic  groups —particularly african americans and hi spanics—would be likely  to occur .', 'with inflation still well above the committee’s longerrun goal of 2  percent , participants agreed that inflation  was unacceptably high.', 'a number of participants commented that the costs of elevated inflation are particularly high for lowerincome households.', 'participants  noted that inflation data received over the past three  months showed a welcome reduction in the monthly  pace of price increases but stressed that substantially  more evidence of progress across a broader range of  prices would be required to be confident that inflation  was on a sustained downward path.', 'participants noted  that core goods prices had declined notably over the previous few months as supply bottlenecks had eased but  anticipated that price declines for this component would  dissipate as the downward pressure on goods prices  from resolving supply bottlenecks fades.', 'participants judged that housing services inflation would likely begin to fall later this year, reflecting continued smaller i ncreases , or potentially declines , in rents on new leases.', 'participants agreed that they had observed less evidence  of a slow down in the rate of increase of prices for core  services excluding housing, a category that accounts for  more than half of the core pce price index.', 'participants   judged that as long as the labor market remained very    minutes of the meeting of january 31–february 1, 2023 page 9 tight, wage growth in excess of 2 percent inflation and  trend productivity growth  would likely continue to put  upward pressure on some prices in this component.', 'a  couple of participants observed  that changes in wages  tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures.', 'a couple of participants remarked that the poor performance of labor  productivity growth last year was  restraining aggregate  supply, which was contributing to imbalances between  aggregate demand  and aggregate supply and therefore to  upward pressure on inflation.', 'several participants noted  the possibility  that as consumers become more price  sensitive , businesses might  accept lower profit margins   in an effort to maintain market share, which could reduce inflation temporarily.', 'participants observed that  indicators of shortterm inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets had come down and that long erterm inflation expectations remained well anchored.', 'a number of participants noted the importance of longerterm inflation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the  risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.', 'in  that adverse scenario, it would be more costly to bring  inflation down to achieve the committee’s statutory objectives of maximum emplo yment and price stability.', 'participants observed  that financial conditions remained  much tighter than in early 2022.', 'however, several participants observed that some measures of financial conditions had eased over the past few months.', 'a few participants noted that increased confidence among  market  participants that inflation would fall quickly appeared to  contribute to declines in market expectations of the federal funds rate path beyond the near term.', 'participants  noted  that it was important that overall financial conditions be consistent with the degree of policy restraint  that the committee is putting into place in order to bring  inflation back to the 2  percent  goal.', 'participants observed  that the uncertainty associated  with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was high.', 'regarding upside risks to  inflation, participants cited a variety of factors, including  the possibility that price pressures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated.', 'participants also saw a number of upside risks surrounding the outlook for inflation stemming from factors  abroad, such as china’s relaxation of its zerocovid  policies and russia ’s continuing war against ukraine.', 'however, a few participants remarked that the risks to their inflation outlook had become more balanced.', 'participants agreed that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside.', 'participants noted that sources of such risks included the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued  growth, the effects of synchronous policy firming by major central banks, and disruptions in the financial system  and broader economy associated with concerns that the statutory debt limit might not be raised in a timely manner.', 'in their discussion of issues related to financial stability, several participants discussed vulnerabilities in the financial system associated with higher  interest rates, including the elevated valuations for some categories of assets ,  particularly in the cre secto r; the susceptibility of some  nonbank financial institutions to runs ; and the effect of  large, unrealized losses on some banks’ securities portfolios.', 'a few participants commented that international stresses had the potential to transmit to the u.s. financi al  system.', 'a number of participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for u.s. treasury  securities and stressed the importance of the appropriate  authorities continuing to address  issues related to the resilience of the market.', 'al though several participants  noted that the federal reserve’s standing liquidity facilities could be helpful in addressing significant pressures in funding markets, should they arise, several participants also noted the challenges of addressing potential disruptions in u.s. core market functioning.', 'a few participants remarked that recent failures of companies involved in crypto finance have had a limited effect  on the  broader financial system .', 'these participants indicated  that this limited effect reflected the minimal extent of  the crypto market’s connections to the banking system  thus far, consistent with the risks associated with many  of these activities.', 'several participants discussed the   value  of the federal reserve taking additional  steps to  understand the potential risks associated with climate  change or to assess the materiality of such risks in the  context of carrying out its responsibilities to evaluate risks in the banking system an d broader financial system.', 'a number of participants stressed that a drawnout period of negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could pose significant risks to the financial system and the broader economy.', 'in their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that the  committee had made significant progress over the past  year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of  monetary policy.', 'even so, participants agreed that ,  page 10 federal open market committee   while there were recen t signs that the cumulative effect  of the committee’s tightening of the stance of monetary  policy had begun to moderate inflationary pressures, inflation remained well above the committee’s longerrun  goal of 2  percent and the labor market remained very  tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on  wages and prices.', 'against this backdrop, and in consideration of the lags with which monetary policy affects  economic activity and inflation,  almost all participants   agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting .', 'many of t hese participants observed that a further slowing in the pace of rate increases would better allow them  to assess the economy’ s progress toward the committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability  as the y determine the extent of future policy tightening  that will be required to attain a stance that is sufficiently  restrictive to achieve these goals.', 'a few  participants  stated that they favored raising the target range for the  federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting  or that  they could have support ed raising the target by that  amount.', 'the participants favoring a 50basis point increase noted  that a larger increase would more quickly  bring the target range close to the levels they believed  would achieve a sufficiently restrictive stance , taking into  account their views of the risks to achieving price stability in a timely way.', 'all participants agreed that it was  appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve ’s securities holdings, as described in its previously announced plans for reducing the size of the  federal r eserve ’s balance sheet.', 'in discussing the policy outlook, with inflation still well  above the committee’s 2 percent  goal and the labor  market remaining very tight, all participants continued to  anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for  the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve  the committee’s objectives.', 'participants affirmed their  strong commitment to returning inflation to the committee’s 2 percent  objective.', 'in determining the extent  of future increases in the target range, participants  judged that it would be appropriate to take into account  the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags  with which monetary policy affects economic activity  and inflation, and economic and financial developments.', 'participants observed that a restrictive policy stance  would need to be maintained until the incoming data  provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained  downward path to 2  percent , which was likely to take  some time.', 'participants discussed the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity.', 'participants generally noted that the committee’s future  decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for  the outlook for economic activity and inflation.', 'a number of participants observed that financial conditions  had eased in recent months, which some noted could  necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy.', 'participants also discussed a number of riskmanagement considerations related to the conduct of monetary  policy.', 'almost all participants observed that slowing the  pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow  for appropriate risk management as the committee assessed the extent of further tightening needed to meet   the committee’s goals .', 'several of those participants observed that risks to the economic outlook were becoming more balanced.', 'with inflation still well above the  committee’s longerrun goal, p articipants generally  noted  that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained  a key factor shaping the policy  outlook , and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly  on a path toward 2  percent  is appropriate from a riskmanagement perspective.', 'a number of particip ants observed that a policy stance that proved to be insufficiently restrictive could halt recent progress in moderating inflationary pressures, leading inflation to remain  above the committee’s 2 percent  objective for a longer  period, and pose a risk of inflation expectations  becoming unanchored .', 'participants noted that the runoff of the balance sheet  had been proceeding smoothly.', 'a few participants  observed that money markets could experience some temporary pressures as reserves dec lined if use of the federal reserve’s on rrp facility continued to remain  high.', 'they noted, however, that such pressures, should  they occur, would likely cause an upward repricing of  private moneymarket rates that could encourage market  participants to reduce their use of the facility.', 'committee policy actions   in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting,  members agreed that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production.', 'members also  concurred that job gains had been robust in recent  months, and the unemployment rate had remai ned low.', 'members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but  remained elevated.', 'members concurred that russia’s  war against ukraine was causing tremendous human and  economic hardship and was contributing to elevated  global uncertainty.', 'members also concurred that they  remained highly attentive to inflation risks.', 'minutes of the meeting of january 31–february 1, 2023 page 11 members agreed that the committee seeks to achieve  maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2  percent over the longer run.', 'in support of these goals,  members agreed to raise the target range for the federal  funds rate to 4 ½ to 4¾ percent .', 'members anticipated  that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy  that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2  percent over time.', 'members concurred that , in determining  the extent of future increases in the target range, they  would take into account the cumulative tightening of  monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.', 'in addition, members agreed  that they would continue reducing the federal reserve’ s  holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and  agency mortgagebacked securities, as described in its  previously announced plans.', 'the committee remained  strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2  percent   objective.', 'members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance  of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the  implications of incoming information for the economic  outlook.', 'they would be prepared to adjust the stance of  monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could  impede the attainment of the committee’s goals.', 'members agreed that their assessments will take into account  a wide range of information, including readings on labor  market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.', 'at the conclusion of the discussion, the committee  v oted to authorize
